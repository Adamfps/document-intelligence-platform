# Cursor Rules for Document Verification MVP

## Code Style
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate

## Error Handling
- Always use try-except blocks for error handling
- Log errors appropriately using the logging module
- Fail gracefully without crashing the application
- Provide user-friendly error messages in the UI

## Scope Management
- Do not add features outside the MVP scope
- Keep the codebase minimal and focused
- Avoid premature optimization or abstraction
- Stick to the defined user flow and architecture

## Code Quality
- Prefer simplicity over complex abstractions
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful comments only when necessary

## Testing Considerations
- Code should be testable but no tests required for MVP
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Validate inputs where necessary
